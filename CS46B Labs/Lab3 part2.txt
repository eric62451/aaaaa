Step 2: Done
Step 3: Its shows all the output that is suppose to be shown in the console when the code ran
Step 4: Same as the output.txt file, we use "cat expected.txt"
Step 5: nothing happends because there is no difference since expected.txt is just a clone of output.txt
Step 6: it shows the difference between the expected and output, output has an extra 5 lines because we chose to save in the input and when we do it again it shows that entry is updated.
Step 7:
ls - list files in home directory
pwd - show what is our home directory
cp - copy file
cat - read file in the console
diff - check difference between 2 files

PART K
Step 1: they are not lined up
Step 2: 63, we checked it from the emac
Step 3: Line 23
Step 4: it is already off because there is a code (setq indent-tab mode nil)
Step 5: there is no 0D at the end of each line, just 0a at the start of each line
Step 6: 0d at the end of each line and 0a at the start of each line
Step 7: it says that there is a syntax error
Step 8: there is no more 0d
Step 9: it worked, and it says i found some files
Step 10: dos2unix ExhibiyB.txt
Step 11: it is c3a9
Step 12: it is e9
Step 13: ExhibitD is right
Step 14: the system doesnt know what encoding the file is
Step 15: Bahrain
Step 16: to say match
Step 17: no match
Step 18: efbbbf4261
Step 19: Ba
Step 20: byte 1 then byte 0
Step 21: by starting with feff it determines the enconding style
Step 22: in utf-8 there is no orders so there is no order mark
step 23: utf 8 has  the byte order mark of efbbbf
Step 24: it says no match ef
Step 25: to ignore the byte order mark.
