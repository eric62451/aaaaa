<h1>Visual Cryptography Kit</h1>

<p>
Visual cryptography (invented by Naor & Shamir in 1994; read their seminal
<a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/vis.ps">paper</a> or
a locally cached <a href="vis.ps">copy</a>) is a method for securely
encrypting messages in such a way that the recipient won't need a computer
to decrypt them. The underlying cipher is essentially the one time pad; so
the system is unbreakable in the information theoretical sense.
<p>
The freely downloadable <a href="vck.zip">Visual Cryptography Kit</a>
(released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <a
href="COPYING.TXT">General Public Licence</a>) allows easy practical
experimentation with this fascinating invention. <small class=comment>It
requires <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a
href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>, both free too; on
Wintel, an easy way to get both in one go is to download Fredrik Lundh's <a
href="http://www.pythonware.com/downloads/py15-980706.exe">precompiled
installation for Win32</a> from his <a
href="http://www.pythonware.com/downloads.htm">goodies page</a>.</small>
<p>
The way this stuff works is basically as follows. You have a "key", which
is an acetate foil with random dots on it (<em>nobody</em> could extract
any useful information from it). You receive a "cryptograph", which is
another acetate with more random dots on it (it too, taken alone, will
yield no information whatsoever to even the most determined of
attackers). But you overlay the key on top of the cryptograph and hey! you
see a secret message. Read my <a href="vck-poster.pdf">poster</a> for a
more detailed and visual introduction, then get the <a
href="vck.zip">software</a> and make some secret messages of your own! Or
if you want a quick start, just photocopy the pictures below on a
transparency, put them on top of each other and see what you get...

I originally implemented some visual cryptography utilities in C++ using
the PBM file formats and conversion tools<!--: <a
href="crittografia-visiva.pdf">here</a> is a description of that
preliminary work (in Italian)-->. But the integration of the various bits
was less than satisfactory. So I rewrote it all as a Python module (view the <a
href="vck.py.html">source code</a> online), based on <a
href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> and Tkinter. This
work was presented as the 7th international <a
href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> <a
href="http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/">conference</a>. The
<a href="vck-poster.pdf">colour poster</a> was designed for A1 paper, but
the A4 version available here, despite being 8 times smaller, will still
print reasonably well on a 600 dpi black and white laser. You can also view
the <a href="vck-abstract.html">abstract</a> (or <a
href="vck-abstract.pdf">PDF</a>) that appeared in the proceedings of the
conference.
<p>
For extra fun, VCK also implements the greyscale variant described in the
original paper: give it a picture of your face and it will split it into
two postscript files that, when combined, will look similar to this (squint
and you might even recognise who this famous personality is...)
