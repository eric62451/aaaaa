Subject: Student Complaint

Dear Professor Mark Stamp,

I have been informed that recently a student from your CS166 class has filed a complaint against you, claiming that you are unfairly grading his homework.
I will need you to explain that during the meeting on April 1st, 3pm at my office.

Regards,

Sami Khuri
